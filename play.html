  <h1>How to play<h1>
  <h2>What the game is</h2>
  <p>This game is a grid based board game.<br>
    The players can move the circle shaped icons.<br>
    However, the player can only control the icon with their color.<br>
    When the circle icon moves, it will leave a cross icon with the same color as the circle.<br>
    This icon blocks the movement of both circles.<br>
    The player can move their own cross icons around<br>
    The circle icon which gets to the other side first wins.<br>
    The player who does each turn first is calculated with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dprh72BLNjIk">Thue Morse sequence</a></p>
  <h2>How to play</h2>
  <p>In each turn the player can move the circle icon, and move a cross icon once.<br>
    The color behind the buttons on the side indicates whose turn it is.<br>
    When the turn is a move turn, the player can press one of the nine buttons to move the circle in the direction of that button.<br>
    When the turn is an edit turn, the player can click squares to select them, and click them again to deselect them.</p>
  <h3>Selection patterns</h3>
  <p>The player can select two of their own cross icons, and one of the opponents cross icons to remove their cross icon at the expense of two of your own.<br>
    The player can select two of their cross icons and one empty square to create a cross icon there at the expense of two others.<br>
    If a selection follows neither of those, nothing will happen.<br>
    When a player is happy with a selection, they can press any of the buttons on the side to apply those rules, and do the next turn.</p>
